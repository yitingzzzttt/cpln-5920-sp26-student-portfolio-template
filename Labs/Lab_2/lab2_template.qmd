## Part 1: Healthcare Access for Vulnerable Populations

### Research Question

**Which Pennsylvania counties have the highest proportion of vulnerable populations (elderly + low-income) living far from hospitals?**

Your analysis should identify counties that should be priorities for healthcare investment and policy intervention.

### Required Analysis Steps

Complete the following analysis, documenting each step with code and brief explanations:

#### Step 1: Data Collection (5 points)

Load the required spatial data:
- Pennsylvania county boundaries
- Pennsylvania hospitals (from lecture data)
- Pennsylvania census tracts

**Your Task:**
```{r}
# Load required packages
library(sf)         
library(tidyverse)  
library(tigris)
setwd("C:/Users/yzhon/OneDrive - PennO365/Penn-Spring 2026/CPLN 592/cpln-5920-sp26-student-portfolio-template/Labs/Lab_2/Pennsylvania_County_Boundaries")
pa_counties<- st_read("Pennsylvania_County_Boundaries.shp")
pa_tracts<- tracts(state = "PA",cb=TRUE,class="sf")
pa_hospitals<-st_read("C:/Users/yzhon/OneDrive - PennO365/Penn-Spring 2026/CPLN 592/cpln-5920-sp26-student-portfolio-template/Labs/Lab_2/hospitals.geojson")

```

**Questions to answer:**
- How many hospitals are in your dataset?
223
- How many census tracts?
3445
- What coordinate reference system is each dataset in?
pa_hospitals=WGS 84 ,"EPSG",4326
pa_tracts=NAD83,"EPSG",4269
pa_counties=WGS 84,"EPSG",3857
---

#### Step 2: Get Demographic Data 

Use `tidycensus` to download tract-level demographic data for Pennsylvania.

**Required variables:**
- Total population
- Median household income
- Population 65 years and over (you may need to sum multiple age categories)

**Your Task:**
```{r}
# Get demographic data from ACS
library(tidycensus)
vars <- c(
  total_pop = "B01001_001",     
  med_income = "B19013_001",    
  m65_66 = "B01001_020", m67_69 = "B01001_021", m70_74 = "B01001_022", 
  m75_79 = "B01001_023", m80_84 = "B01001_024", m85_plus = "B01001_025",
  f65_66 = "B01001_044", f67_69 = "B01001_045", f70_74 = "B01001_046", 
  f75_79 = "B01001_047", f80_84 = "B01001_048", f85_plus = "B01001_049"
)
pa_census_data <- get_acs(
  geography = "tract",
  variables = vars,
  state = "PA",
  year = 2022, 
  output = "wide" 
)
pa_demographics <- pa_census_data %>%
  mutate(
    elderly_pop = rowSums(select(., m65_66E:f85_plusE)),
    elderly_pct = (elderly_pop / total_popE) * 100
  ) %>%
  rename(
    total_population = total_popE,
    median_income = med_incomeE
  ) %>%
  select(GEOID, NAME, total_population, median_income, elderly_pop, elderly_pct)

# Join to tract boundaries
pa_tracts_with_data <- pa_tracts %>%
  left_join(pa_demographics, by = "GEOID")

```

**Questions to answer:**
- What year of ACS data are you using?
2022
- How many tracts have missing income data?
62
- What is the median income across all PA census tracts?
70188
---

#### Step 3: Define Vulnerable Populations 

Identify census tracts with vulnerable populations based on TWO criteria:
1. Low median household income (choose an appropriate threshold)
2. Significant elderly population (choose an appropriate threshold)

**Your Task:**
```{r}
# Filter for vulnerable tracts based on your criteria
pa_valid_data <- pa_tracts_with_data %>%
  filter(!is.na(median_income)) %>%
  filter(total_population > 0)

income_limit <- 55924
elderly_limit<- 37.7


pa_vulnerable_populations <- pa_valid_data %>%
  mutate(
    is_vulnerable = ifelse(
      !is.na(median_income) & 
      median_income <= income_limit & 
      elderly_pct >= elderly_limit, 
      TRUE, 
      FALSE
    )
  ) %>%
  filter(is_vulnerable == TRUE)

```

**Questions to answer:**
- What income threshold did you choose and why?
55924, I use the 75% quantile. quantile(pa_valid_data$elderly_pct,0.25, na.rm = TRUE)

- What elderly population threshold did you choose and why?
37.7, I found that the 75th percentile is approximately 25%. This means this threshold helps me identify the top 25% of communities with the highest aging levels across the state. quantile(pa_valid_data$elderly_pct,0.75, na.rm = TRUE)

- How many tracts meet your vulnerability criteria?
209

- What percentage of PA census tracts are considered vulnerable by your definition?
209/3445=6.07%
---

#### Step 4: Calculate Distance to Hospitals 

For each vulnerable tract, calculate the distance to the nearest hospital.

**Your Task:**
```{r}
pa_vulnerable_projected <- st_transform(pa_vulnerable_populations, 2272)
pa_hospitals_projected <- st_transform(pa_hospitals, 2272)

vulnerable_centroids <- st_centroid(pa_vulnerable_projected)

distance<- st_distance(vulnerable_centroids,pa_hospitals_projected)

pa_vulnerable_projected$dist_to_hospital_miles <- as.numeric(apply(distance, 1, min)) / 5280
```

**Requirements:**
- Use an appropriate projected coordinate system for Pennsylvania
- Calculate distances in miles
- Explain why you chose your projection
I use South Philadelphia projection CRS.

**Questions to answer:**
- What is the average distance to the nearest hospital for vulnerable tracts?
3.538635

- What is the maximum distance?
19.15822

- How many vulnerable tracts are more than 15 miles from the nearest hospital?
7
---

#### Step 5: Identify Underserved Areas 

Define "underserved" as vulnerable tracts that are more than 15 miles from the nearest hospital.

**Your Task:**
```{r}
pa_vulnerable_projected<- pa_vulnerable_projected %>%
  mutate(is_underserved = dist_to_hospital_miles > 15)


```

**Questions to answer:**
- How many tracts are underserved?
7

- What percentage of vulnerable tracts are underserved?
7/209=3.34%

- Does this surprise you? Why or why not?
Yes, because there are almost 20,000 of population have to go to hospital that is more than 15 miles away.
---

#### Step 6: Aggregate to County Level

Use spatial joins and aggregation to calculate county-level statistics about vulnerable populations and hospital access.

**Your Task:**
```{r}
# Spatial join tracts to counties
pa_counties_projected <- st_transform(pa_counties, 2272)
vulnerable_with_county <- st_join(pa_vulnerable_projected, pa_counties_projected)

# Aggregate statistics by county
county_summary <- vulnerable_with_county %>%
  group_by(NAMELSADCO) %>%
  summarize(
    num_vulnerable_tracts=n(),
    num_underserved_tracts = sum(is_underserved),
    avg_distance=mean(dist_to_hospital_miles),
    total_vulnerable_population=sum(total_population,na.rm = TRUE))%>%
      mutate(
        pct_vul_tracts_underserved=((num_underserved_tracts / num_vulnerable_tracts)*100)
      )

```

**Required county-level statistics:**
- Number of vulnerable tracts
- Number of underserved tracts  
- Percentage of vulnerable tracts that are underserved
- Average distance to nearest hospital for vulnerable tracts
- Total vulnerable population

**Questions to answer:**
- Which 5 counties have the highest percentage of underserved vulnerable tracts?
Forest County, 	Juniata County, Monroe County, Sullivan County,Dauphin County

- Which counties have the most vulnerable people living far from hospitals?
Forest County

- Are there any patterns in where underserved counties are located?
Underserved counties are primarily concentrated in the rural, mountainous central and northern regions of PA, where low population density leads to sparse hospital coverage.
---

#### Step 7: Create Summary Table 

Create a professional table showing the top 10 priority counties for healthcare investment.

**Your Task:**
```{r}
library(knitr)
# Create and format priority counties table
top_10_counties<-county_summary%>%
  st_drop_geometry()%>%
  arrange(desc(pct_vul_tracts_underserved))%>%
  head(10)%>%
  mutate(
    avg_distance = round(avg_distance, 1)
  )
  

top_10_counties %>%
  kable(
    col.names = c("County Name", "Vulnerable Tracts", "Underserved Tracts", 
                  "Avg. Distance (mi)", "Total Vulnerable Pop", "% Underserved"),
    caption = "Top 10 Pennsylvania Counties Prioritized for Healthcare Investment",
    align = "lccccc"
  )

```

**Requirements:**
- Use `knitr::kable()` or similar for formatting
- Include descriptive column names
- Format numbers appropriately (commas for population, percentages, etc.)
- Add an informative caption
- Sort by priority (you decide the metric)

**Your Task:**
```{r}
# Create detailed tract-level map




```

**Requirements:**
- Show underserved vulnerable tracts in a contrasting color
- Include county boundaries for context
- Show hospital locations
- Use appropriate visual hierarchy (what should stand out?)
- Include informative title and subtitle

---

### Chart: Distribution Analysis

Create a visualization showing the distribution of distances to hospitals for vulnerable populations.

**Your Task:**
```{r}
# Create distribution visualization




```

**Suggested chart types:**

- Bar chart of underserved tracts by county
- Scatter plot of distance vs. vulnerable population size

**Requirements:**
- Clear axes labels with units
- Appropriate title
- Professional formatting
- Brief interpretation (1-2 sentences as a caption or in text)

---

## Part 3: Bring Your Own Data Analysis 

Choose your own additional spatial dataset and conduct a supplementary analysis.

### Challenge Options

Choose ONE of the following challenge exercises, or propose your own research question using OpenDataPhilly data (https://opendataphilly.org/datasets/). 

**Note these are just loose suggestions to spark ideas - follow or make your own as the data permits and as your ideas evolve. This analysis should include bringing in your own dataset, ensuring the projection/CRS of your layers align and are appropriate for the analysis (not lat/long or geodetic coordinate systems). The analysis portion should include some combination of spatial and attribute operations to answer a relatively straightforward question**
